    "FAQ": {
      "question1": "Translated Does the IOTA Foundation track my data and usage?",
      "answer1": "Translated We can’t! This solution puts data control in your hands. We have no way of accessing the data on your phone. Whenever you share data in the demo environment, you communicate this information to our servers, but it will be removed as soon as you complete the demo or close the connection. Also, only functional cookies are used on this website and during the demos. Once companies run demos or applications on their own servers, the IOTA Foundation, and other parties, will not be aware of the usage or data. For peer-to-peer sharing via QR codes, no information leaves the two communicating phones.",
      "question2": "Translated Can I restore my data if I lose my phone?",
      "answer2": "Translated Not yet. This is currently a demonstration application, which means it doesn’t have all the features that a full release would have. The application is using (mostly) fake data, therefore recovery is not on top of mind. Backups will be available in a future update.",
      "question3": "Translated Does my personal data get uploaded to the Tangle?",
      "answer3": "Translated No, absolutely no personal information is uploaded to the Tangle in accordance with GDPR regulations. Not even in a (pseudo)anonymized state. Any personal data uploaded to the Tangle would be in violation of \"the right to be forgotten\" as Tangle data is immutable.",
      "question4": "Translated How does this application benefit from IOTA and DLT in general?",
      "answer4": "Translated Organisations sign credentials for the users, but how do we identify the organisations? Their digital identities are uploaded to the Tangle via 0-value transactions and are signed using asymmetric encryption methods. In addition, retraction of credentials are put on the Tangle as evidence that the credential can no longer be used.",
      "question5": "Translated On what IOTA network does this application run?",
      "answer5": "Translated The mainnet! IOTA has zero fees, so it isn’t any more difficult to run this demo on the mainnet then on the devnet.",
      "question6": "Translated How can I learn more?",
      "answer6": {
        "part1": "Translated We released a whitepaper called:",
        "part2": "Translated The Case for a Unified Identity",
        "part3": "Translated It is a relatively easy introduction to the subject and explains what the benefits are of a Unified Identity Protocol."
      },
      "question7": "Translated What is a DLT or Tangle?",
      "answer7": "Translated Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) describes the concept of replicated, shared and synchronized digital data without any centralized administration. The current state of the data stored within the ledger is achieved in a decentralized consensus. \n The most well-known form of a DLT is blockchain, however blockchain comes with significant shortcomings such as scalability issues and transaction fees. The so called Tangle is a novel architecture of a DLT that aims to mitigate those shortcomings. It is the underlying DLT of the IOTA Cryptocurrency Token, developed by the IOTA Foundation.",
      "question8": "Translated Who developed the Selv Digital Identity Management Demo?",
      "answer8": "Translated Selv is developed by the IOTA Foundation, the Digital Identity Management Demo was developed in a collaboration with de Volksbank. The IOTA Foundation is a non-profit foundation guiding and contributing to the development of the core protocol and facilitating the development of the ecosystem around IOTA."
