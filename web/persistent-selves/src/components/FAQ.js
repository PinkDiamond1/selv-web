		answer: 'There are nine planetary boundaries within which humans can continue to develop and thrive for generations to come. These nine processes (Climate change, Freshwater use, Land use change, Biodiversity loss, Ocean acidification, Chemical pollution, Nitrogen and Phosphorus loading, Air pollution, and Ozone layer depletion) regulate the stability and resilience of the Earth system. Crossing these boundaries increases the risk of generating large-scale abrupt or irreversible environmental changes.'
